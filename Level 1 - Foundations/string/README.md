# String Data Structure

In computer programming, a string is a sequence of characters. It is typically implemented as an array of characters. Strings are used to represent text.

## Key Features
- **Immutable/Mutable**: Depending on the language (e.g., Java Strings are immutable; C++ Strings are mutable).
- **Sequence**: Ordered collection of characters.

## Time Complexity (General)

| Operation | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- |
| Access | O(1) |
| Concatenation | O(n + m) |
| Substring | O(n) |
| Search | O(n) |

## Common Operations
1.  **Concatenation**: Joining two strings.
2.  **Substring**: Extracting a part of the string.
3.  **Length**: Finding the number of characters.
4.  **Comparison**: Checking if two strings are equal.
5.  **Searching**: Finding a character or substring within the string.
