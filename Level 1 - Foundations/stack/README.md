# Stack Data Structure

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

## Key Features
- **LIFO**: Last In First Out.
- **Single End**: All operations (push, pop, peek) happen at the same end, called the *top*.

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| :--- | :--- |
| Push (Insert) | O(1) |
| Pop (Remove) | O(1) |
| Peek/Top | O(1) |
| IsEmpty | O(1) |

## Common Operations
1.  **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2.  **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
3.  **Peek/Top**: Get the value of the top element without removing it.
4.  **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
