# Array Data Structure

An array is a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations. Arrays work on an index system starting from 0 to (n-1), where n is the size of the array.

## Key Features
- **Fixed Size**: The size of an array is defined at the time of declaration and cannot be changed.
- **Contiguous Memory**: Elements are stored in consecutive memory blocks.
- **Random Access**: Any element can be accessed instantly using its index.

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Access | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Search | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Insertion | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Deletion | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |

## Common Operations
1.  **Traversal**: Visiting each element of the array.
2.  **Insertion**: Adding an element at a specific index.
3.  **Deletion**: Removing an element from a specific index.
4.  **Search**: Finding the index of an element.
5.  **Update**: Changing the value at a specific index.
