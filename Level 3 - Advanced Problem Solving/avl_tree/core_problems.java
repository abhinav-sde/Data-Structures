     * Discussion: AVL vs Red-Black Trees
     * AVL: More strictly balanced (height diff ≤ 1). Better for search-heavy
     * workloads.
     * Red-Black: Looser balance (height ≤ 2 log N). Fewer rotations on
     * insert/delete.
     * 
     * Industry: Red-Black wins for general purpose (Java TreeMap, C++ std::map).
     * AVL wins for read-heavy databases and lookup tables.
